## Peek
We think there's nothing worse than a big context switch when all you want is to quickly check something. That's why we support peeked editors. When you execute a Peek References search (via Shift+F12)

```
Shift+F12
```

## Errors and Warnings
Warnings or Errors can be generated either via configured tasks, by rich language services, or by linters, that constantly analyze your code in the background. Since we love bug-free code, warnings and errors show up in multiple places:

* In the Status Bar, there is a summary of all errors and warnings counts.
* You can click on the summary or press Ctrl+Shift+M to display the PROBLEMS panel with a list of all current errors.
* If you open a file that has errors or warnings, they will be rendered inline with the text and in the overview ruler.

## Find and Replace control
The Find and Replace control appears in the upper right corner of the code editor window. The Find and Replace control immediately highlights every occurrence of the given search string in the current document. You can navigate from one occurrence to another by choosing the Find Next button or the Find Previous button on the search control.

```
CTRL+F2
```

## Command Palette
VS Code is equally accessible from the keyboard. The most important key combination to know is Ctrl+Shift+P, which brings up the Command Palette. From here, you have access to all of the functionality of VS Code, including keyboard shortcuts for the most common operations.

```
CTRL+SHIFT+P
```

## Side Bar
Toggle side bar on and off

```
CTRL+D
```

## Side by Side Editing
You can open as many editors as you like side by side vertically and horizontally. If you already have one editor open, there are multiple ways of opening another editor to the side of the existing one

```
CTRL+ENTER
```
